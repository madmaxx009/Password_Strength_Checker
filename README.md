Password Strength Checker

## Description 
This tool evaluates the strength of a given password based on multiple criteria including length, use of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides instant feedback to help users improve their passwords and ensure better security.

## Features 
- **Password Length**: Ensures the password has at least 8 characters.  
- **Uppercase Letters**: Checks if the password contains uppercase letters (A-Z).  
- **Lowercase Letters**: Checks if the password contains lowercase letters (a-z).  
- **Numbers**: Verifies if the password includes numeric digits (0-9).  
- **Special Characters**: Ensures the inclusion of special characters (e.g., !@#$%^&*()).

## How It Works  
The script evaluates the password based on the following five criteria:

1. Length: The password must be at least 8 characters long.  
2. Uppercase Letters: At least one uppercase letter (A-Z).  
3. Lowercase Letters: At least one lowercase letter (a-z).  
4. Numbers: At least one number (0-9).  
5. Special Characters: At least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*()).

The password's strength is classified as:
- **Weak**: Meets fewer than 3 of the criteria.  
- **Moderate**: Meets at least 3 criteria.  
- **Strong**: Meets all 5 criteria.
